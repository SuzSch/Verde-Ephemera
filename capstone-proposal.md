# Capstone Proposal Details

## Student
**Suzanne Schuber** 

## Project Name
**VerdeEphemera - "Savor Life's Temporal Joys."** 

## Project Purpose/Goal
**Create a website for a fictional/my fantasy business that combines a Cafe, Bakery, Library, and Florist.** 

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features
- Develop a main splash page that is aesthetically pleasing and fully functional.
- Fully build at least two out of the four business branches: Library and Florist.

- Create static pages with limited functionality for the Cafe and Bakery, to be expanded upon as time allows and as further practice.

## Technologies and Resources
- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **Backend Framework:** ASP.NET
- **Optional Language:** TypeScript
- **Library API:** Consider using [Google Books](https://developers.google.com/books) API or [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) API for the Library section.
- **E-commerce/Online Ordering/Reservations:** Explore options for implementing these features for both the Library and Florist sections.

## Next Steps after MVP
- Continue building out the Cafe and Bakery sections of the website.
- Enhance functionality and user experience across all sections.

## Additional Resources for Next Steps
- Could add a MySQL (or other) database to keep track of menu items/customers.
