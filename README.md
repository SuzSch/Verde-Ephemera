# VerdeEphemera - "Savor Life's Temporal Joys"

## **By Suzanne Schuber** 

### Project Description

VerdeEphemera is a web-based app designed for a fictional business that combines a Cafe, Bakery, Library, and Florist. This README provides an overview of the project's purpose, goals, technologies, and progress.

### Project Goals

The primary goal of VerdeEphemera is to create a multi-faceted website that combines the following branches of business:

1. **Library:** A library where users can explore, search for books, and reserve/check-out books.
2. **Florist:** A section where users can view and purchase floral arrangements and related products.
3. **Cafe:** A delightful cafe experience featuring a menu of delicious food and beverages.
4. **Bakery:** A bakery offering a range of baked goods, pastries, and treats.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features

To achieve the project's initial goals, the following features are planned for the MVP:

- A functional main splash page with an appealing design.
- Full functionality for the Library and Florist branches.
- A static version of the Cafe and Bakery sections with limited functionality, to be expanded later.
- Integration of React and potentially TypeScript for frontend development.
- Utilization of external APIs, such as Google Books or Open Library, for the Library section.
- Implementation of e-commerce and online ordering/reservation features for the Library and Florist sections.

### Next Steps

Once the MVP is completed, the project will move forward with these additional features:

- Further development of the Cafe and Bakery sections to full functionality.
- Enhanced user experience and additional features for all branches.
- Implementation of customer accounts, loyalty programs, and reviews.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React for the user interface, with potential use of TypeScript.
- **Backend:** ASP.NET for server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **Database:** A database system (e.g., MySQL) for data storage.
- **Authentication:** User authentication for accounts and security.
- **Deployment:** Deployment of the frontend and backend components as needed.

### Project Status

As of now, the project is in its early stages, with a focus on planning, frontend development, and initial API research. The MVP is the immediate goal, followed by ongoing development to bring the entire concept to life.
